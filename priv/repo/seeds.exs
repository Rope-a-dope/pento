# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:

#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs

# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your

#
#     Pento.Repo.insert!(%Pento.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.
